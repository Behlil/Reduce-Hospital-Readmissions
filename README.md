# Hospital Readmission Analysis

## Description
This project aims to help a hospital group better understand patient readmissions by analyzing ten years of data on patients who were readmitted to the hospital after being discharged. The project explores the following questions:

- What is the most common primary diagnosis by age group?
- How does a diabetes diagnosis affect readmission rates?
- Which groups of patients have a high probability of readmission and should be prioritized for follow-up care?

The project uses Python and various libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn to perform data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and modeling. The project also includes a report that summarizes the findings and recommendations.
